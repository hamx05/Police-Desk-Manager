# Police Desk Manager

A streamlined and efficient Police Desk Manager built in C++ during my 2nd semester (Spring 2024) at FAST NUCES. The system helps manage police records like FIRs, criminal records, lost & found items, and personnel data.

### ⭐ Features
- Secure login for authorized users
- CRUD operations for managing records
- File-based data storage
- Console-based interface

### 📚 What I Learned
- **OOP Concepts:** Applied inheritance, modularity, and class design.
- **Fundamentals of Programming:** Practiced file handling, loops, and conditionals.
- **System Design:** Focused on creating a maintainable and cohesive structure.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **C++** – Primary programming language
- **OOP** – Applied object-oriented principles (inheritance, encapsulation)
- **File Handling** – Used for persistent storage
- **Console Interface** – Simple, text-based UI for interaction

### 🚀 How to Run
```bash
g++ utils.cpp police-dept.cpp fir.cpp criminal.cpp lost-items.cpp found-items.cpp login.cpp main.cpp -o police_department
./police_department
```
